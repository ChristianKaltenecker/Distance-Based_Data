We have used http://mattmahoney.net/dc/uiq/ to generate a 632 MB big file and have measured the compression of this file.
Note that this tool generates files that are not too easy and not too difficult to compress.
The measurements were performed with version 0.600 on a machine with AMD Athlon64 Dual Core, 2 GB RAM (Debian GNU/Linux 6).
