We claim the replication badge, since (1) we have implemented and documented the sampling strategies and the machine-learning technique in the publicly-available open-source tool SPL Conqueror, (2) we make all raw data needed to execute the sampling and machine-learning process publicly available, and (3) we provide the scripts that we used for data processing.
As one would need multiple weeks of CPU time for reproducing our results (which includes whole population measurement data and predictions), we provide also the raw data to short-cut this costly process on demand.
For simplicity, we provide a dockerfile in addition to a manual setup on Linux.
Overall, only basic knowledge with Linux and (optionally) Docker is needed for the replication of our results.
